title: "Game Theory"

This website is part of the course *Behavioral Ecology* at Uppsala University. It consists of two parts:

1. We first explore the model presented in Chapter 6 of Kokko (2007) but takes the analysis it bit further. This part consist of three parts:
    + The first tab, *The Basic Plant Game*, repeats the analysis presented by Hanna Kokko.
    + The second tab, *Evolution of Plant Height*, goes a bit further by introducing *Pairwise Invadability Plots* (something that Hanna Kokko does in Chapter 7 of her book in the context of a different model.)
    + Finally, in the third tab, *Evolution in the Modified Plant Game*, introduces a tweak to the basic model. This modification results in a model in which plants with different heights are able to coexist in a stable polymorphism, just as we see in any natural forest.
 
2. In the second part (in the fourth tab), we explore the evolution of altruism. As a specific example, we investiage a model in which individuals can sacrifice their own life in order to increase the survival of other (related) individuals.
